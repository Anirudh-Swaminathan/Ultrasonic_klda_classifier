Contains our pattern recognition project files, which is about performing a dimensional reduction using the KLDA technique and performing a classification by employing a probabilistic approach.

The operations are performed on a dataset named "Ultrasonic flowmeter diagnostics Data Set" hosted in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The Dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ultrasonic+flowmeter+diagnostics).
