## Instructions
1. Run classify1.py on all 4 meters by changing the file name each time the code is run.
2. Note down the results for each meter.
3. Run r_prep.py for all the 4 meters to obtain data compatible with R code.
4. Choose a meter and do the following steps
    a. Run KLDA.py
    b. Change the name of the save file appropriately
    c. Run classify.py on the saved file.
    d. Run KLDA.r
    e. Change the name of the save file appropriately
    f. Run classify.py on the saved file
    g. Compare the results for no dimensionality reduction, dimensionality reduction using native Python and dimensionality reduction using R package
5. Repeat step 4 for different values of the target dimension
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 for different kernel functions(Kernel functions link is given in the R code itself)
